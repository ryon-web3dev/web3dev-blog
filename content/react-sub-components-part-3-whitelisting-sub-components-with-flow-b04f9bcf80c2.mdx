_This small post is the continuation of_ [_my second article about sub-components_](https://medium.com/maxime-heckel/react-sub-components-part-2-using-the-new-context-api-6f1c089acfe4)_. To fully understand this article please read that first_

In Part 2 of my React sub-components series, we saw how using Context could greatly improve the original pattern I’ve described in [my first post](https://medium.com/maxime-heckel/react-sub-components-513f6679abed). However, one regression came along with this improvement and in this article we’ll bring a solution to it thanks to static typing.

## Current issue

The sub-component pattern described in the previous post addressed a few issues of the original implementation, but introduced one regression: children that are not properly defined as sub-components are still being rendered.

Originally, the `findByType` util was being used to render our sub-components and would skip any unknown sub-components. The code snippet below shows this regression. You can give it a try by pulling the example project [here](https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/react-sub-components-context/tree/flow) and following the instruction in the README to run it. You can try switching the imports of `<App/>` in `index.js` to see how both implementation defer.

```javascript title=Incorrect usage of a subcomponent
<Article>
  <Article.Title />
  {/* 
          This will render if we use the sub-component pattern described in part 2,
          but will be skipped with the one described in part 1 (the findByType util 
          mentioned in the post will simply not render "<div></div>" as it's not
          a known sub-components of <Article/>.
        */}
  <div>Hello World</div>
  <Article.Metadata />
  <Article.Content />
</Article>
```

This regression breaks one of the main advantages of using sub-components: narrowing the scope of what can be rendered within a given component to make sure it is used properly and avoiding a messy codebase.

To fix this, as I mentioned at the end of the previous article, I decided to use static typing. The main idea here is to provide a specific `type` for the `Article` component, so that only a given list of components (i.e. our sub-components) will be rendered within it.

## Flow to the rescue

Let’s see how static typing can fix the main caveat of the sub-component pattern that is implemented with contexts. I’m going to use [Flow](https://flow.org/) here to handle my types.

The gif below shows the actual implementation of using static typing to whitelist the sub-components of `Article` . You can see that before adding `<div>Hello</div>` as a child of `Article`, running Flow against my codebase returns no errors. However, once I add this extra piece of code, Flow will output the following error:

```shell
Cannot create Article element because in property type of array element of
property children:
 • Either div [1] is incompatible with typeof Title [2].
 • Or div [1] is incompatible with typeof Metadata [3].
 • Or div [1] is incompatible with typeof Content [4].
```

![Gif showing that running flow with a non valid sub-component fails](/static/images/1__HqiRL5mQ6tRCONrSivQ5cQ.gif)

As you can see, Flow is aware of the type of our sub-components (and of any children of `Article` ), and reports that `div` is not compatible with one of these types.

To make sure to catch whether someone misuses `Article` in our codebase, we can simply add Flow as a step in our CI pipeline. Additionally, there are many editor extensions available to highlight whenever a component is not use correctly given its Flow type.

## How to achieve whitelisting with Flow

First, we need to add Flow to our project. For that, I recommend following [this guide](https://flow.org/en/docs/tools/babel/). Once done, running `flow` at the root of the project should output no errors since we haven’t typed anything in our codebase yet.

Then we’ll need to do some modifications to our `Article.js` file. First, we’ll have to change any sub-components declared as a functional component to a full class. This is due to the fact that classes have their own type but functional components do not. If we want to whitelist children, this is going to be the only limitation here.

Then, we’ll have to declare the types¹ of our sub-components, i.e. the children of `Article` . For that we’ll declare a type `ArticleSubComponent` which will be of type `Title` or of type `Metadata` or of type `Content` .

Finally, we need to associate that type to the `children` prop of `Article`. Our component can have either 1 or more children, thus the type should either be **an array of React elements** of type `ArticleSubComponent` if `Article` has 2 or more children or **a single React element** of type `ArticleSubComponent` if it has 1.

The code snippet bellow shows the resulting component:

```javascript title=Article.js
// @flow
import * as React from 'react';

// This creates the "Article Context" i.e. an object containing a Provider and a Consumer component
// $FlowFixMe
const ArticleContext = React.createContext();

// We use classes here instead of functional components for our sub-components
// so we can define a type for each one of them

// This is the Title sub-component, which is a consumer of the Article Context
class Title extends React.Component<{}> {
  render() {
    return (
      <ArticleContext.Consumer>
        {({ title, subtitle }) => (
          <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
            <h2>{title}</h2>
            <div style={{ color: '#ccc' }}>
              <h3>{subtitle}</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        )}
      </ArticleContext.Consumer>
    );
  }
}

class Metadata extends React.Component<{}> {
  render() {
    return (
      <ArticleContext.Consumer>
        {({ author, date }) => (
          <div
            style={{
              display: 'flex',
              justifyContent: 'space-between',
            }}
          >
            {author}
            {date}
          </div>
        )}
      </ArticleContext.Consumer>
    );
  }
}

class Content extends React.Component<{}> {
  render() {
    return (
      <ArticleContext.Consumer>
        {({ content }) => (
          <div style={{ width: '500px', margin: '0 auto' }}>{content}</div>
        )}
      </ArticleContext.Consumer>
    );
  }
}

// The ArticleSubComponent type is either of type Title, Metadata or Content
// any other type is not supported by this component, and will result in an
// error in flow if use as a child of Article
type ArticleSubComponents = typeof Title | typeof Metadata | typeof Content;

type Property = string | Node;

type ArticleObject = {
  title: Property,
  subtitle: Property,
  author: Property,
  date: Property,
  content: Property,
};

// Here we type the props of our Article component
type Props = {
  value: ArticleObject,
  // We assign the children prop its type: either an array of React elements of
  // type ArticleSubComponents (if Article has 2 or more children)
  // or just a React element of type ArticleSubComponents (if Article
  // only has 1 child)
  children:
    | Array<React.Element<ArticleSubComponents>>
    | React.Element<ArticleSubComponents>,
};

// This is our main Article components, which is a provider of the Article Context
const Article = (props: Props) => {
  return (
    <ArticleContext.Provider {...props}>
      {props.children}
    </ArticleContext.Provider>
  );
};

Article.Title = Title;
Article.Metadata = Metadata;
Article.Content = Content;

export default Article;
```

There are surely other solutions to address this issue, but this is the one I’m exploring as it uses dependencies and patterns that I’m already using in most of my projects.

Feeling like playing with Flow types and sub-components? I’ve made available this specific example on a branch named `flow` on the same repository that I’ve used as an example for the previous post. Check it out [here](https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/react-sub-components-context/tree/flow)!
