_This post is part of an informal series of small articles focusing on Flow types usages that I’ve discovered and found useful over the past few months. The first article of this series can be found_ [_here_](https://medium.com/@MaximeHeckel/how-to-efficiently-type-your-styled-components-with-flow-f43930a0dd2b)_._

Building generic React components can be a great way to simplify the codebase of a project. By combining overlapping functionalities into a single component, we reduce the entropy of components and thus reduce the amount of testing needed. However, typing generic React components can be a bit of hassle at first, especially when you‘re just getting started with Flow. This post will focus on one example of a generic React component that I was struggling to type a few months ago, and how Flow generics helped me to not only overcome the typing issues but also to build a scalable type for this component.

## From multiple typed components to one

In the project I was working on, I had to handle multiple resources (named here `Resource1`, `Resource2`, `Resource3`, … for simplicity). Each resource had its own associated`List` component (`Resource1List`, `Resource2List`, …), each of which was pretty similar to the others in terms of implementation, as the resources themselves were quite the same outside of a few differences. Below, you can see the types of `Resource1` and `Resource2` :

```javascript title=Example resource Flow types
type Resource1 = {
  id: string,
  name: string,
};

type Resource2 = {
  Id: string,
  name: string,
};
```

So given these specs, I wanted to build a single `ResourceList` component to display items of a given resource. Its props would include an `onItemClick` callback function, which takes a variable of that resource type as an argument. Here’s the first type that I wrote for the props of the `ResourceList` component:

```javascript title=The first iteration of the “Props” Flow type for ResourceList
type Props = {
    // other props
    onItemClick = (
        Resource1 |
        Resource2 |
        // other resource Flow types fo here
    ) => void,
}
```

Now that the component is typed, the next step consists of trying to use it with one of our Resources. Here’s how `ResourceList` can be used for `Resource1` for example:

```javascript {7} title=Resource1List React component using ResourceList
import React from 'react';
import ResourceList from 'components/ResourceList';
import type { Resource1 } from 'core/types';
...

class Resource1List extends React.Component {
  onResource1Click = (item: Resource1) => {
    const { name, id } = item;
    // some action on Resource1 fields
  };

  ...

  render() {
    return <ResourceList onItemClick={this.onResource1Click(item)} />;
  }
}
```

This is the moment when I ran into the main problem. Given the way I typed this component, running Flow against the code in the example above outputs an error:

<Image

  alt="Flow error output with the first iteration of the “Props” Flow type for ResourceList"
  layout="responsive"
  width={700}
  height={448}
/>

In the Resource types we declared above ( `Resource1`, `Resource2` , …), you can see that the key of the “id” field of each Resource doesn’t match. Thus, whenever we will use this component and write an `onItemClick` function for a resource, Flow will give you an error telling us the properties of the other resources are missing.

## How to use generics

To overcome this kind of situation, generics can be very practical. This is how we can end up typing this component and fix this issue:

- we can provide a generic `BaseProps` type which takes a generic type `T`
- use `T` inside `BaseProps` for our`onItemClick` function which will take an item of type `T` as argument and thus be of type `T => void`
- declare `Resource1Props` , `Resource2Props` , etc, based on `BaseProps`
- write the type `Props` as an enum of `Resource1Props`, `Resource2Props`, etc.

The resulting code looks like this:

```javascript {1-4} title=ResourceList “Props” Flow type using a generic BaseProps Flow type
type BaseProps<T> = {
    // other props
    onItemSelect = T => void,
};

type Resource1Props = BaseProps<Resource1>;
type Resource2Props = BaseProps<Resource2>;

type Props = Resource1Props | Resource2Props;
```

Running Flow with this type should output the following:

<Image
  src="blog/1__tQs3TltRtn__sntDOaUxdLg_i5wixf.png"
  alt="Flow output with no errors thanks to the new ResourceList “Props” Flow type!"
  layout="responsive"
  width={700}
  height={245}
/>

We have now typed our generic list component properly thanks to Flow. We can see that using generics not only brings flexibility to our type, but also will help in the future when we want to scale up the usage of this component, so it can be used with even more resources.
