## First contact with Framer Motion

I recently took the time to check out [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), the current most popular React library for animating components. I've never been good at building smooth efficient transition, and even now I still have a lot to learn, but it's been surprisingly easy to transition some of the components powering this blog to use Framer Motion instead of CSS animations.

The projects I usually work on, however, rely heavily on styled-components built with Emotion, which allows me to write both animations and transitions with CSS syntax.
When converting these same animations to Framer Motion, I found myself wrapping my existing styled-components in a `motion.div` component and migrate any animation code to this element. Little to say, it was tedious work, and I also wasn't satisfied with the resulting code:

```js
const StyledButton = styled('div')`
  height: 48px;
  margin: 0;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: inline-flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  position: relative;
  font-weight: 600;
  outline: none;
  padding: 0 30px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background-color: #5184f9;
  color: white;
  min-width: 150px;
`;

render(
  <motion.button
    whileHover={{ scale: 0.85 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
    style={{ background: 'transparent', border: 'none' }}
  >
    <StyledButton>Hello There</StyledButton>
  </motion.button>
);
```

Note: You can head over to the [Header component code of this blog](https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/gatsby-theme-maximeheckel/commit/6445fcdbb76a49081b4391b42ec8a24e6c387315#diff-f56a115185fe156c022628a0ce949fadR27) to see another example of this first iteration that I still accidently shipped.

## Cleaner implementation

Although the code above is working, I wanted to be able to declare a single component to hold both the style and the animation while keep using styled-components. My first instinct was to I try to wrap a `motion.button` into Emotion's styled function as follows:

```js
const StyledButton = styled(motion.button)`
  height: 48px;
  margin: 0;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: inline-flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  position: relative;
  font-weight: 600;
  outline: none;
  padding: 0 30px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background-color: #5184f9;
  color: white;
  min-width: 150px;
`;

render(
  <StyledButton whileHover={{ scale: 0.85 }} transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}>
    Hello There
  </StyledButton>
);
```

It worked! I now had a way to get my styled-components to use Framer Motion based animations and transition without requiring some extensive rewrite ðŸŽ‰! The component showcased above is now able to take the props of a Framer Motion component, and I can tweak my animations and transitions directly from its props: no extra wrapping needed.

I also found out you could achieve a similar result by wrapping my styled-components in a `motion.custom` function, but couldn't find any documentation about it.

If you're still curious and want more examples of components I built this way, here's a list of some of the ones I rewrote on my gatsby-theme that powers this blog and my [portfolio](https://maximeheckel.com):

- the [Button styled-component](https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/gatsby-theme-maximeheckel/blob/master/src/components/Button/Button.tsx#L16) with a [scale on hover animation](https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/gatsby-theme-maximeheckel/blob/master/src/components/Button/Button.tsx#L155).
- [SearchBoxOverlay](https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/gatsby-theme-maximeheckel/blob/master/src/components/SearchBox/index.tsx#L389) with [blur animation](https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/gatsby-theme-maximeheckel/blob/master/src/components/SearchBox/index.tsx#L160): it blurs progressively the view while the search box appears to emphasize the focus on the search input and search results.
- [SearchResults component](https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/gatsby-theme-maximeheckel/blob/master/src/components/SearchBox/index.tsx#L332) with a [slide down animation](https://github.com/MaximeHeckel/gatsby-theme-maximeheckel/blob/master/src/components/SearchBox/index.tsx#L198): the search result list may vary in size dependending on the length of the list of results for a given search query, this animation aims to smooth a bit the transition between two result lists.

I still have a lot to try with Framer Motion, I feel I barely scratched the surface and that I'm doing a couple of wrong things. Stay tuned for some future blog posts about my findings and what I learned using this library ðŸ™Œ.
