```js snippet
console.log('Hello, World!');

/**
 * This is the first code snippet shared in the "Snippet" section
 * (name is still TBD and the layout still in progress ðŸ˜…)
 * of my blog (https://blog.maximeheckel.com).
 *
 * In this section, I plan on sharing short code samples that you
 * might find interesting or helpful but that don't necessarily
 * deserve an article just yet. This is meant to be used as a
 * second brain on my end, but also as a quick way to share some
 * of my coding knowledge more often and in a shorter format.
 *
 * Hope this will help me post more regulary some content on this
 * site, but also will help you in your day to day work.
 *
 * See you soon for more code snippets and blog post
 *
 * Have a good one! ðŸ‘‹
 * - Maxime
